# Execution Canceled

Context data for an exit caused by a cancellation from the host.

## Syntax
```C
//
// Context data for an exit caused by a cancellation from the host (WHvRunVpExitReasonCanceled)
//
typedef enum WHV_RUN_VP_CANCEL_REASON
{
    WHvRunVpCancelReasonUser = 0 // Execution canceled by WHvCancelRunVirtualProcessor
} WHV_RUN_VP_CANCEL_REASON;

//
// Alias for non-standard capitalization found in earlier versions of the header
//
#define WhvRunVpCancelReasonUser WHvRunVpCancelReasonUser

typedef struct WHV_RUN_VP_CANCELED_CONTEXT
{
    WHV_RUN_VP_CANCEL_REASON CancelReason;
} WHV_RUN_VP_CANCELED_CONTEXT;
```

## Remarks

Information about an exit caused by the host system is provided in the `WHV_RUN_VP_CANCELED_CONTEXT` structure.

Note that the numerical value of WHvRunVpExitReasonCanceled is different between x64 and Arm64.
